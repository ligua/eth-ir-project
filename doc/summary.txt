# Near/exact duplicate detection algorithm

For each document:

1. Tokenize document into words, discarding word counts.
2. Calculate 128-bit md5 hash of each word.
3. Combine word hashes into a 128-bit fingerprint of current document using SimHash.
4. Bitwise compare the fingerprint of current document against table of fingerprints of all previously detected unique documents:
	-> if all bits match => exact duplicate
	-> if at least 90% of the bits match => near duplicate.
5. If current document wasn't an exact duplicate, add it to table of fingerprints.

Note that our code allows using multiple permuted fingerprint tables and multi-word shingles by just changing a few parameters.
